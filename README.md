  ## Description
This repository hosts a program built with Node.js, Inquirer version 8.2.4 and JavaScript. I takes in information regarding employees such as managers, software engineers and interns. Based on the information provided you will be building a team through generated questions in the command-line that are equipped with specific role by role questions. Each role has different requirements of information that will need to be provided. <br>
After you have answered the prompts this program is designed to create a file and render a HTML page with all the roles and data entered. From here you will have a team built in the structure that you provided the data in.

  ## Usage
  This program assists those needing to build a team electronically. It has a hierarchy built into it for organization purposes. The manager will appear at the top followed by the engineers and interns. This can be a powerful tool for companies with multiple teams. You can view who is in charge of what teams, the engineers and interns allocated to that specific team, and all of the information regarding their specified roles. This will assist employers and leadership in saving time as well as organization for implementing tasks and development of projects.
